                        <h3>College Career</h3>
                        <p>I carried a 3.5 GPA or higher during my college career as well as participating in various clubs, most notably our 
                            Game Development Club, in which we learned the basics of game development and expand our knowledge of programming
                            in the process. I also interned at Cambridge Investment Research, which is a company that sells financial solutions 
                            to CPA's all the way to businesses. During my time at Indian Hills Community College, I learned skills that I will carry 
                            with me throughout my professional life and personal life.
