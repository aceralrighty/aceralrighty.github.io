                    <p>I believe that having an active life   is a surefire way of
                        increasing your mental clarity and overall outlook. In this industry it's very
                        important to be able to solve problems on the fly, too often do I see other 
                        people in this industry not put in the work on their physical health. As my father says: "Becauase of the mind, the body suffers".
                        I believe it works both ways, because of the body the mind suffers as well.

                    <p>While I do believe in pushing yourself and staying active, the body and mind need time to recover as well.
                        Which is why I find settling in watching a good movie or show or read a book or listening to a podcast or just sitting 
                        outside calm me down and give my mind a rest from the daily workload significantly improve performance and longevity.

                    <p>For me, family and recovery are not mutually exclusive. Family is very important to me, without them I wouldn't be where I am today, so I try to spend time with them
                        when I can.

                    <p>I love traveling. I'm very fortunate to have visited many countries in Europe like Italy, Sicily and the black forest in Germany to name a few
                        and some States here in America and I can't wait to travel to another place I haven't been to yet.
