        <p>
            I was born in Florida, from a young age my family had been moving around, I lived in Kansas, Texas and my family eventually ended up back in Israel, the birth place of my parents. I lived in Israel for 12 years of my life, I went to high school there and after high school I went into my mandatory military service.
            After my service, I moved back to the States and lived in Texas for 3 years before I decided to go back to school and get my Associates Degree in Computer Software Development at Indian Hills Community College. There, I worked and developed my programming skills further, as well sharpen my communication, creative & critical thinking skills.
